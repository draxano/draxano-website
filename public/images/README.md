# Images Directory

Place your background images and other static images here.

## Background Image for Home Page

Place your DRAXANO logo/background image in this folder. The recommended filename is:
- `draxano-hero-background.jpg` (or `.png`, `.webp`, etc.)

The image will be used as the background for the hero section on the home page.

## Usage

Images placed in the `public/images/` folder can be referenced directly in your CSS or components using:
- `/images/your-image-name.jpg`
