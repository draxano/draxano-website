title: "GameWOW"
description: "GameWOW is a real-time online multiplayer party game platform enhanced by commentators. Players choose from multiple social games—trivia, bluffing, drawing, comedy, and creativity challenges—while three distinct GameMasters provide live commentary, trash talk, encouragement, and post-game roasts. The system emphasizes social interaction, replayable chaos, and personality-driven entertainment, making gameplay feel more like a live show than a traditional party game."
